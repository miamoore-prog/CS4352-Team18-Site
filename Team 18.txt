Team 18Please carefully review heuristic evaluations and feedback of your project by other students. Issues marked with asterisks (*) are critical, and we look forward to seeing them resolved in your final presentation.P1Heuristic Violated : H2: Match Between the System and the Real World *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (Log in and view tools)]Description :The language selector shows that a language needs to be selected, but technically, English is already select and is an option in the menu. If I switch and then go back to English, it still says Select a LanguageSuggestion to Fix :Get rid of select a language and keep the default English Heuristic Violated : H6: Recognition Rather than RecallSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 (Interact with Community)]Description :Not clear that “Back to tools” is a buttonSuggestion to Fix :Add a background to the text to visibly indicate that it is a button Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3 (Manage content as admin)]Description :Clicking hide refreshes the entire page and sends you all the way to the topSuggestion to Fix :Have the list update without refreshing the entire page so that the user is suddenly sent to the top after pressing the button Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design *Severity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (Log in and view tools)]Description :Card design for AI has a lot of information and can be reduced to not be overwhelmingSuggestion to Fix :Reduce information on card and use the view more button which does exist for showing more info Heuristic Violated : H10: Help and DocumentationSeverity Level : [4]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3 (Manage content as admin)]Description :Unclear what to do in field like ID (slug) for creating toolSuggestion to Fix :Make the ID (slug) more clear to the user as to what an example ID should look like Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and Standards *Severity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3 (Manage content as admin)]Description :The tool creator says Create New Tool but the text at the bottom for the button says Add toolSuggestion to Fix :Change the Add tool text to create tool Overall RecommendationsThere is a lot on this website and so it would be helpful if it was more minimalist and clear on its instructions like the ID (slug). Additionally the text on the buttons should stay consistent like create too vs add tool. Buttons need to have a visual background like the back to tools button.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P2Heuristic Violated : H2: Match Between System & Real World *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2: Interact with community]Description :The search bar placeholder text is unclear making it harder for users to search posts or comments naturallySuggestion to Fix :Use clearer phrasing such as “Search posts…” Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control & Freedom *Severity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Users can’t manually scroll the carousel and have to wait to read information they might’ve missedSuggestion to Fix :Add manual arrows or allows users to drag/swipe Heuristic Violated : H6: Recognition Rather Than RecallSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Cards on the carousel seem to be interactive but aren’t so they cause confusion for usersSuggestion to Fix :Make each card on the carousel clickable links Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic & Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Uneven spacing between cards on the Explore page distracts users from the contentSuggestion to Fix :Adjust pacing and use consistent margins/padding Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency & Standards *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :There’s an inconsistency of the colors where the buttons are blue but other clickable text are purple cause confusion in users in what’s clickable and what’s notSuggestion to Fix :Apply the same global color scheme throughout the site Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2: Interact with community]Description :The most recent comments aren’t shown first so user’s comments get lostSuggestion to Fix :Show comments in chronological order with most recent comments first Overall RecommendationsTeam 18 has visual inconsistency, unclear interactivity, and weak feedback. The carousel can’t be manually controlled by users, some cards look clickable but aren’t, and the color and spacing on the website isn’t consistent. The search bar also has unclear wording and the most recent comments aren’t seen first. This team should standardize their website’s layout and colors while hinting at what features are interactive and which aren’t. They should also let users manually control the carousel and improve sorting and feedback so that user actions are more predictable.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P3Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and Standards *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :One of the task steps was to bookmark a tool, this was confusing because when you click on a tool it does not show the bookmark button, only when you are in the menu.Suggestion to Fix :They should add the bookmark button inside the panel when you click on the tool and make it bigger and easier to see. Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :When you click on the tools, you see that there are various ratings for the tool, but there is no indication of the average rating.Suggestion to Fix :Add a field for average rating, also you can see every update the user did for the tool, that seems excessive and clutters the screen, show only the last update. Heuristic Violated : H10: Help and Documentation *Severity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Some of the tasks required me to either Manage Tools or Manage Community, Neither of these were obvious where they were, they were hidden in a dropdown.Suggestion to Fix :These should be somewhere in the center of the page and obvious, I had no idea they were in the dropdown. Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System Status *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :There are 2 indicators here, you can see that the posts are deleted by admin, but there’s another button to delete it again, this makes it hard to tell what post is in what state.Suggestion to Fix :Remove the second delete button and maybe put a line through the text or make it gray to show its no longer visible. Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use. *Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 and Task 3]Description :Searching felt a little unintuitive, I tried to search by author and felt it was not returning properly. Also, there should be some kind of summary of the article or filtering options as there are no dates.Suggestion to Fix :Add a preview of the article and add more filtering options for the articles like sorting by when they were posted. Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :When closing a request, you get a popup that tells you are you sure, but it does not tell you which one exactly you are closing so this can lead to confusion and closing the wrong request.Suggestion to Fix :Add an indicator that tells you which request you are closing in the popup window so you know exactly what you are doing. Overall RecommendationsI think that the UI could benefit from some rearrangement of where certain links are, for example a lot of the tools are hidden in a dropdown window, those are confusing and I did not know how I was supposed to know where they are. Additionally, I think that the community tabs are cluttered and confusing for the admin to see all the posts and updates that relate to a certain thread, I think that it could be simplified and certain buttons should be removed to show the state of the post.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P4Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Login and view tools]Description :The button to exit the review tab is unviewable when the user scrolls downSuggestion to Fix :X icon should be fixed to top corner of the tab regardless of scrolling position Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Login and View Tools]Description :The AI descriptors have differing thickness when text overflowsSuggestion to Fix :Make descriptor size fixed Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Under language settings, 'Select Language' has an arrow next to it like the languages do, making it seem as if it is a language as wellSuggestion to Fix :Remove arrow Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :There's no indication in top menu which tab is selectedSuggestion to Fix :Bolden tab title when user navigates to that tab Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Interact with Community]Description :There's no description for articles past title and authorSuggestion to Fix :Add a brief description Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Interact with Community]Description :The '+' button to add a post is hard to find (on left, away from the articles in the center)Suggestion to Fix :Move button closer to main content Overall RecommendationsI would recommend small UI fixes to make the styling consistent and easily understood. The main suggestion is adding tab indication on main menu to allow user to know which tab they are in.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P5Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [Level 2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (View Tools)]Description :The main navigation menu uses the label "Explore", but the page itself is clearly for tools, titled "AI Compass" with descriptions about each AI tool. The URL path even uses /tools. This inconsistency across navigational elements, page titles, and intent violates Internal Consistency (H4), confusing the user about the site structure.Suggestion to Fix :Maintain Internal Consistency. Rename the navigation link from "Explore" to the more accurate label, "Tools" or "Tool Directory"Heuristic Violated : H6: Recognition rather than Recall *Severity Level : [Level 2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (view tools)]Description :On the tool listing page, the search bar's placeholder text is: "Try: 'write email', 'create an image', or 'automate a workflow'". This wording suggests the bar is meant to be a direct AI Prompt for the user (like using ChatGPT itself), rather than a search bar for filtering/finding AI tools. It is hard to tell what the search bar is even for. This forces the user to recall or guess the actual function, violating Recognition.Suggestion to Fix :Change the placeholder text to explicitly state the action, such as "Search tools by name or category".Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [Level 1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (view tools)]Description :In the "Add review" pop-up, the suggested tags (chat, writing, coding, assistant) are different sizes. The inconsistent sizing of these elements violates Aesthetic and Minimalist Design by introducing visual clutter and unnecessary variance, making the page look unpolished and distracting from the core content.Suggestion to Fix :Keep a consistent style and make sure all the tags are the same font and size and padding.Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [Level 3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 (Interact with Community)]Description :The community feed doesn’t show the most recent comments this forces the user to manually expand the threads and scroll to find recent comments, which reduced efficiency.Suggestion to Fix :Display the most recent comments directly under each post by default.Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [Level 2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 (Interact with Community)]Description :There is no quick way to acknowledge a comment without typing a full reply (there is no like button).Suggestion to Fix :Add a like button to comments.Heuristic Violated : H2: Match between System and the Real WorldSeverity Level : [Level 2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 (Interact with Community)]Description :The community page uses a search bar placeholder that says: "Describe your query in Natural Language". This wording does not match how users typically think about or use search bars in real-world applications. Most users expect straightforward language like "Search posts" or "Search community," so phrasing it this way feels technical and unfamiliar.Suggestion to Fix :Use more natural and familiar language. Rename the placeholder to something users would immediately understand, such as "Search Community Posts" or "Search Topics", so the feature aligns with common real-world wording and expectations.Heuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [Level 3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3 (Manage content as Admin)]Description :After a comment is deleted, the interface still shows the delete button, allowing the admin to attempt deletion again. This can cause confusion or lead the user to believe the first deletion did not work. The system should prevent users from repeating an action that is no longer valid.Suggestion to Fix :Disable or hide the delete button once the comment has been removed and replace it with a single clear status indicator such as “Comment Removed,” ensuring the user cannot perform the action twice.Overall RecommendationsThe UI needs clearer labeling, more intuitive language, and stronger visual consistency to reduce confusion and help users understand the system at a glance. Several issues stem from inconsistent terminology and unfamiliar prompts, such as using “Explore” to describe a tools directory or showing placeholder text that reads more like an AI prompt than a traditional search bar. Renaming navigation labels and placeholders to match user expectations would make the site easier to understand and help users instantly recognize what each feature does without guessing. Visual consistency also needs improvement, as inconsistent styling (like mismatched tag sizes) adds unnecessary visual noise and makes the interface feel less polished.Community interaction task can also be made faster and more efficient by reducing unnecessary user effort. Adding common interaction shortcuts, such as a like button, would allow users to quickly acknowledge comments without typing replies. Displaying the most recent comments by default would also make it easier to keep up with community activity. Finally, preventing invalid actions(such as allowing deleted content to be deleted again) would reduce confusion and potential mistakes. Disabling buttons once an action is complete and providing a clearer status indicator would help users stay informed and avoid repeating steps unnecessarily.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P6Heuristic Violated : H10: Help and DocumentationSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The main pages with the explanation is only written and doesn’t really help visual learners.Suggestion to Fix :Maybe include a small video guide to help better engage users on how to use these toolsHeuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Only has a login button, no sign-up for new users that would like to create an accountSuggestion to Fix :Include a sign-up option for new usersHeuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :When clicking links it would take you to the official webpage of the AI tool that is being looked at unexpectantly.Suggestion to Fix :Maybe tell the user that the link would take you to another tab/pageHeuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :Difficulty finding where my booked marked pages were.Suggestion to Fix :Include a tab for bookmarks made towards the other tab optionsHeuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :This page is very simple and lacks visual interest.Suggestion to Fix :Maybe add a thumbnail for each tabs that gives a slight insight on what the topic would be.Heuristic Violated : H10: Help and DocumentationSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 and 3]Description :The links only show the title and the author no date of posting or other information such as a short summary is show.Suggestion to Fix :Include a short summary and a post date of the article and have a way for us to adjust search by either date or key words for a more efficient search method for users.Overall RecommendationsGreat website with a helpful idea for those who don’t understand AI tools. Not much wrong with it just maybe make it more engaging because it is on the simple side of things.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P7Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Images in the “Featured AI Tools” carousel failed to load, resulting in a weird looking broken image icon.Suggestion to Fix :Implement fallback/placeholder icon or have a dedicated “image unavailable” text/icon in cases of images failing to load Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :Community page has minimal contrast, page feels dense and hard to skim. Lack of colors/visual clarity makes all the posts kind of “blend together”Suggestion to Fix :Add more visual contrast between posts and comments, make it have some more different colorsHeuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :When commenting on a post/thread with enough comments to show a “view more” button, the comment I just posted wouldn’t show up and I would need to click “view more” to try and see itSuggestion to Fix :Have it so when the user comments, it always shows once it’s posted, maybe under the “view more” button so it keeps the thread’s chronological structure. Alternatively, just expand the whole chain when a new comment is posted and/or scroll to the newly added comment once posted. Heuristic Violated : H9: Error RecoverySeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 & 3]Description :When trying to click on the “view more” button on any thread (like in the slide above), the website just displayed a “thread not found” error page. This happened on every thread I tried, whenever I clicked the “view more” button to see the rest of the comments/the whole threadSuggestion to Fix :I’m not sure if the error is caused because threads aren’t fully implemented or what, so it’s hard to suggest a fix (i.e. if it’s because of lack of implementation I’d say to just implement it) but one other thing is that there’s no button to “go back” to the thread you were viewing before once you reach this error page, so that would be nice to have. If threads are implemented and the error was just happening for some reason, maybe have the error show up as a popup in the current screen (i.e. community screen showing a thread) instead of taking the user to a whole new screen with just a “thread not found” text Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :In admin view, it shows a “delete (again)” button, which is unexpected and it’s not clearly defined what that even means or doesSuggestion to Fix :Usually, comments are either as-is or deleted by admin, so maybe replace the “delete (again)” button with a “restore” button so comments can be “undeleted” by the admin as well. Alternatively, if “delete (again)” means doing like a “hard” delete where it doesn’t even show as “deleted by admin” in the chain, just reword it as “Hard Delete” or “Permanently Delete”Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :This one’s just a small nitpick, but the alignment between the “hidden/visible”, “hide/unhide”, and edit elements on the right get shifted based on the content. In the ChatGPT row, you can see that since it’s visible and the option is “Hide”, it doesn’t line up with the rest of the columns anymore.Suggestion to Fix :Use padding/fixed width to prevent layout shift Overall RecommendationsOverall the website was pretty good, I liked the carousel for the featured AI tools on the homepage (though I’d like to see the image loading issues resolved). The theming/color contrast could use a bit more work, as currently it’s a bit bland and sometimes hard to distinguish different posts/comments in the community page. Also requires some polish regarding clarity and error handling (delete again button and thread issue)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P8Heuristic Violated : H[7]:Flexibility and efficiency of useSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :No bookmark button while looking at detailsSuggestion to Fix :Add bookmark button there Heuristic Violated : H[4]: Consistency and standardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :Quick summary hard to read compared to the restSuggestion to Fix :Make bolder, larger, or remove from the bottom and add to top Heuristic Violated : H[12]: InteractivitySeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : []Description :Suggestion to Fix :Shorten the time to finish a simple task Heuristic Violated : H[3]: User control and freedomSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :No way to add pictures easily for tool creationSuggestion to Fix :Add picture upload Heuristic Violated : H[13]:Security and PrivacySeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :Contact info may not be safely storedSuggestion to Fix :Add cyber attack counter measures if not already added Heuristic Violated : H 7: Flexibility and efficiency of useSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :No way to contact through the site itself, rather than a third party sourceSuggestion to Fix :Add a method to contact the devs Overall RecommendationsOverall a very well put together project. The tasks were needlessly long and did not need to be so. It should not have taken 5 mins for task 1. Other issues were minor.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P9Heuristic Violated : H2: Match between System and the Real WorldSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 (Login & view tools)]Description :The interface places bookmarked tools under the Manage Profile drop down, where then you must go to manage tools. This is not an intuitive or meaningful location for this feature. It took extra time to locate where bookmarked tools were stored and this violates the match between system and the real world heuristic because the labeling does not match common user expectations. It also affects Task 1, which involves navigating and viewing the tools available.Suggestion to Fix :Move bookmarked tools to a clearly labeled section within the tools page. Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The tags displayed in the pop-up use a pill shape style, that is associated with clickable buttons, like filters. However, these are static labels with no interactions. This is a direct violation of the consistency and standards heuristic because even though they match the pattern for a clickable element they behave differently. During Task 1, when users view and explore tools, they may mistakenly assume these tags can be clicked to filter or navigate to related content.Suggestion to Fix :if these tags are static, use a text style that doesn't have the pill shape. Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of UseSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The quick summary for each tool is placed at the very bottom of the pop-up, even though summaries are meant to give users an immediate understanding of what the tool does. Placing this section last forces users to scroll through the entire description before reaching the most essential information. This violates the flexibility and efficiency of use heuristic because it slows down the expected information hierarchy and slows down the user’s ability to quickly assess a tool’s importance.Suggestion to Fix :Move the quick summary to the top of the pop-up Heuristic Violated : H5:  Error PreventionSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :The interface includes a delete (again) option beneath posts that have already been flagged and soft-deleted. This appears to be the action for permanently deleting a post, but the label is ambiguous and provides no indication of the consequences. This violates the error prevention heuristic because the interface fails to prevent accidental destructive actions. Users may permanently delete content without realizing what the action does or without intending to do so.Suggestion to Fix :Rename this action to something  unambiguous such as permanently delete or delete permanently (cannot undo) Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The interface uses purple for both the active navigation button and the disabled one, and because the purple has low contrast against the beige background, it becomes very difficult to tell that the previous button is inactive when viewing the first tool. visibility of system status requires that the interface clearly communicates what actions are available or unavailable. When a disabled button blends into the background or looks too similar to the active one, users cannot easily understand the system’s current state. This directly affects Task 1 (viewing tools) because users rely on these navigation buttons to move between tool listings.Suggestion to Fix :Change the color for a disabled navigation to be grey instead of a light purple. Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :When selecting View Reviews from the Read More pop-up, the interface takes the user to a separate reviews page. However, using the back navigation does not return the user to the tool they were viewing and instead, it sends them back to the home page. As a result, the user loses their place entirely and must re-find the tool from the beginning. This violates the User Control and Freedom heuristic because users are unable to easily reverse their navigation or return to their previous state. Since task 2 involves interacting with community and looking at reviews, this unexpected behavior disrupts the flow of exploration.Suggestion to Fix :Implement a back button that returns the user to the exact tool or pop-up they came from No back button within this page that takes you back to the “read more”Overall RecommendationsThe structure and hierarchy of tool details could be improved to better support efficient use. Important information, such as quick summaries or direct access to the tool, should appear at the top of pop-ups rather than buried at the bottom. Several issues stem from unclear system status, such as navigation buttons that lack proper visual contrast and back-navigation that unexpectedly resets users to the home page. It is important to make sure that disabled states are visually distinct, and that the system preserves a user’s place when returning from a page.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P10Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Buttons like Sign In, Search, and Comment do not provide any loading state or confirmation. When logging in, pressing “Sign in” gives no indication that the system is processing the request. Similarly, posting comments does not show a temporary “Submitting…” feedback, making the user unsure whether the input was accepted.Suggestion to Fix :Add loading spinners, success messages, or subtle UI feedback such as disabling the button while processing. Heuristic Violated : H2 — Match Between System and Real WorldSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :The search bar says “Search by topic or author…”, but users must enter extremely specific wording to get results. The system does not use natural language like the placeholder text implies. This mismatch between expectation and actual system behavior can cause confusion.Suggestion to Fix :Implement fuzzy search, autocomplete, or adjust the placeholder text to reflect exact supported search types Heuristic Violated : H3 — User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :Users can delete comments, but there is no undo option and no confirmation dialog. Accidental deletions cannot be reversed. The “Delete” text link is small and easy to misclick, especially when multiple comments are clustered together.Suggestion to Fix :Add a confirmation modal or a temporary “Undo” snackbar. Heuristic Violated : H4 — Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Button styles, borders, and colors vary across pages. This inconsistency makes it harder for users to recognize which actions are primary and secondary.Suggestion to Fix :Create a style guide for buttons and apply it across the site. Heuristic Violated : H6 — Recognition Rather Than RecallSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :The floating purple “+” button on the community screen has no label. Users must recall what it does rather than recognizing the action. The button’s meaning is unclear to first-time users.Suggestion to Fix :Add a tooltip (“Create post”), or include a label (“New Post”) next to the icon. Heuristic Violated : H10 — Help and DocumentationSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :The site has multiple features (search, articles, community moderation, flagged posts) but provides no onboarding, no explanations, and no tooltips. Users have to guess how features like flagged posts, admin deletion, or mock login users work.Suggestion to Fix :Add a short help section or contextual tooltips near major features such as search, flagging, or posting. Overall RecommendationsSeveral interaction issues affect usability. Across all screens, the absence of feedback, mild inconsistencies in UI elements, and lack of help or guidance cause unnecessary confusion for new users. Community interactions (posting, deleting) need safeguards to prevent irreversible user errors.To improve the experience, the team should focus on: Adding status indicators and confirmation messages, unifying button styling across pages, supporting more flexible and intuitive search, labeling ambiguous icons, providing lightweight help or onboarding for new users----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P11Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency & StandardsSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The login page provides no information about password requirements like any formatting rules. Even though this is a mock login, a real system should clearly communicate expectations. Users may become confused if their password fails without explanation or may assume any password is valid.Suggestion to Fix :The team should provide a short note beneath the password field showing acceptable password formats, such as minimum character length or whether special characters are required. For example, the password must be at least 8 characters.Heuristic Violated : H10: Help & DocumentationSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :This page shows a search bar but gives no examples or explanation of what types of searches are supported. Users may not know whether they can search by tool name, topic, author, tags,  or natural-language prompts. This lack of instruction makes the search feature feel unclear, especially since similar fields on the homepage do offer example prompts.Suggestion to Fix :The team should provide examples or hint text beneath or inside the search bar, such as search by article title, topic, or author. Also, they could add a small question mark icon that opens a brief tooltip explaining what kinds of searches the system supports.Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic & Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :The community feed shows unnecessary detailed information such as comment deleted by admin, duplicate delete (again) links, and admin moderation logs directly within the main feed. This adds clutter and makes the page visually overwhelming, making it harder for users to focus on actual posts and comments.Suggestion to Fix :The team should hide deleted comment logs behind a collapsible button option or show them only on a separate admin dashboard. They can remove redundant actions such as delete (again) and keep moderation buttons consistent. Also, using muted styling or small icons for admin-only actions can reduce visual clutter.Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency & StandardsSeverity Level : [4]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :On the login screen, the system lists test usernames and passwords directly on the page. While this might be intended for testing, it creates a confusing experience because users normally expect to enter their own credentials, not see preset ones.Suggestion to Fix :The team should add standard login cues to match user expectations. For example, placeholder text like enter username, and hide the test-account instructions behind a collapsible link. This keeps familiarity and follows common login UI patterns.Heuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2 and 3]Description :The interface allows users and admins to delete posts or comments with a single click and no confirmation step, which makes it very easy to accidentally remove content. Since the delete link is small and placed close to the timestamp and text, users may click it unintentionally. For admins, accidentally deleting community posts is especially harmful and hard to undo and increases the chances of irreversible errors.Suggestion to Fix :The team can add an “Are you sure?” confirmation pop up, or add an undo option that appears immediately after deletion. Also, they can increase spacing between post content and admin actions, or convert delete into a more intentional button to reduce accidental clicks.Heuristic Violated : H10: Help & DocumentationSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Tasks 1 and 2]Description :The homepage encourages users to find the right AI tools, but provides no guidance on how to actually use the search bar or explore tools. The placeholder examples look like generic text suggestions, not actual instructions or supported features.Suggestion to Fix :The team can add an info icon explaining what the search bar supports, Also, they can provide a short guided walkthrough on first.Overall RecommendationsAI Compass has a well-structured interface with easy navigation across login, home, articles, and community features. The platform’s visuals are consistent and the overall layout makes it easy to move between sections. Most of the usability issues came from missing standard UI cues and a lack of clear feedback during interactions, which can cause uncertainty for new users. Strengthening consistency and improving feedback would make the experience smoother and closer to user expectations.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P12Heuristic Violated : H7: Flexibility and Ease of UseSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Login & View Tools]Description :Featured AI Tools is a carousel animation that moves at its own rateSuggestion to Fix :Display Featured AI Tools in a list format so users who are looking for a specific tool can easily find it without waiting for the carousel to do a cycleHeuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Manage Content as Admin]Description :Unflag and delete buttons are both in red, right next to each other, and may seem similar in meaning to unfamiliar usersVery easy for users to mistake the two and accidently click on unflag (which means they would have to scroll through all the threads to find it again to delete!)Suggestion to Fix :Differentiate unflag and delete by using different colors (unflag button could be gray with a red flag symbol next to it)Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Interact with Community]Description :When writing a review, if your review is empty, the submit review button is still active and clickable (even though clicking on it does nothing, since the review is empty)Suggestion to Fix :Gray out the submit review button until the user has written in the text boxHeuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Interact with Community]Description :Close button to exit out of the AI tool screen is not easily discoverable, the gray blends into the backgroundSuggestion to Fix :Change the gray close button into a red X close buttonHeuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Login & View Tools]Description :Overview of AI tool contains a lot information, clutteredTwo descriptions given for each tool (one in gray underneath the title, the other in black underneath that)Suggestion to Fix :Consolidate the two descriptions into a single one-liner, additional information can be included when the user clicks into the AI toolHeuristic Violated : H2: Match Between System and Real WorldSeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [Manage Content as Admin]Description :“Describe your query in Natural Language” doesn’t align with user vocabularySuggestion to Fix :More user-centric and natural phrasing such as “Ask your question here…”Overall RecommendationsThe site is overall very intuitive to use, both as an admin and as a user. As an admin, I recommend clearly differentiating between the unflag and delete buttons (e.g. change the color and add a flag icon), since they are both in bright red next to each other, and its easy for users to misclick. In addition, I recommend changing the wording on the search posts to reflect more natural language (e.g. “Ask your question here”).In addition, I think that there is too much information when viewing tools overall, and the description for each AI tool could be shortened into a single line. Additional information can be displayed if the user clicks into that specific tool. The featured AI tools carousel should also be changed into something that the user is more easily able to view at their own pace (e.g. a list).Finally, when the user is submitting reviews, I recommend only enabling the button when text is written in the review box. To make it easier for users to exit, I also recommend changing the gray close button into a red X icon.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P13Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The look of the chat box makes it feel like you’re getting answers for your question when it’s just the best-fit AI tool. Gives a bit of false impression.Suggestion to Fix :Clarify the purpose of the chatbox by having an indication like “Tool Selector” Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The AI options seem to be preset. I’m not sure of the logic behind getting the right AI.Suggestion to Fix :Add more logic to suggest new AI tools instead of a preset 18. Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control/FreedomSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :The 4 language options, that aren’t too common. It makes more sense to have more.Suggestion to Fix :Expand language menu to include more variety like Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi. Or have a dropdown for all languages. Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [1]Description :Profile shows minimal info, so it’s not clear what the user is able to do.Suggestion to Fix :Add more detail in the features like Account Settings, Security, etc. and create more dropdowns off of those Heuristic Violated : H9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from ErrorsSeverity Level : [4]Task(s) Affected : [2]Description :There was a 404 error when clicking on the Community buttonSuggestion to Fix :Repair the backend code and have user-friendly error message. Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control & FreedomSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :There’s no delete options for the posts as an adminSuggestion to Fix :Add “Delete” for every post before “Edit”, only accessible by admin. Overall RecommendationsImprove transparency/logicEnhance the Error Handling responses and fix up on errorsIncrease the options for user control----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P14Heuristic Violated : H[1]: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [High]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :The homepage provides no clear indication of what the system is doing when users interact with UI elements. There are no loading indicators, progress states, or acknowledgment cues. This leaves users unsure whether the system registered their input.Suggestion to Fix :Add subtle loading spinners, button state changes, animated progress bars, or micro-interactions that confirm system activity after every major action.Heuristic Violated : H2: Match Between System and the Real WorldSeverity Level : [Medium]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :Terms like “AI Compass,” “Navigate the Future,” and “AI Pathfinder” appear metaphorical and may confuse first-time visitors. Users may not immediately understand that the site helps match them to AI/tech career paths.Suggestion to Fix :Use clearer, real-world phrasing in the hero section such as: “Find Your Ideal AI/Tech Career Path” with a supporting sub-description that states the site's actual function.Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [Medium]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :Once a user begins interacting with the website, there is no way to undo, restart, or go back. Users may feel “trapped” if they want to explore alternate flows on half-view mode.Suggestion to Fix :Add clear Back buttons to provide users with flexibility and escape hatches.Heuristic Violated : H6: Recognition Rather Than RecallSeverity Level : [Medium]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2/3]Description :[The output sections provide options but with limited explanation. Users must recall what the roles mean or what skills correspond, forcing them to rely on prior knowledge.]Suggestion to Fix :[Show preview summaries for each recommended AI tool: typical rules, required skills, etc. Use tooltips and collapsible info to keep the interface clean.]Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [Medium]Task(s) Affected : [ All]Description :Button shapes, text sizes, and spacing appear inconsistent across sections. Fonts and color usage lack standardization, which reduces the sense of a cohesive, trustworthy tool.Suggestion to Fix :Create a style guide or UI system: consistent button styling, spacing tokens, color hierarchy, and type scale. Apply these consistently across the site.Heuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [Low]Task(s) Affected : [all]Description :Several sections feel text-heavy without enough visual grouping or hierarchy. Users may have difficulty scanning content or distinguishing important actions from general information.Suggestion to Fix :Improve visual hierarchy with headings, spacing, icons, and chunking. Use whitespace, section dividers, and card layouts to simplify navigation and reduce cognitive load.Overall RecommendationsUsers must immediately understand the purpose, see system activity, and receive richer explanations for recommendations. A unified design system and improved navigation flexibility will significantly enhance trust and usability.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P15Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [3 – Major Usability Problem]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :No back button on the page, which limits user’s ability to go backSuggestion to Fix :Add back buttonHeuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [3 – Major Usability Problem]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 – Login and View Tools]Description :The same search showed different results, which can lead confusion to the userSuggestion to Fix :Ensure the search results are consistentHeuristic Violated : H9: Error RecoverySeverity Level : [3 – Major Usability Problem]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 – Login and View Tools]Description :When clicking on the page linked under tools, the page is broken, which user does not expect and can lead to user and confessionSuggestion to Fix :Ensure links are available or redirecting users to the right placesHeuristic Violated : H10: Help and DocumentationSeverity Level : [2 – Minor Usability Problem]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3 – Manage Content as Admin]Description :No guide under how to guide, which causes confusion for the user on how to use the AI toolSuggestion to Fix :Add the ”How to Guide” section for the Nano BananaHeuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [Level 1 – Cosmetic Problem]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Different font for the language selection which is inconsistent stylingsSuggestion to Fix :Ensure that the same font type is used consistently throughout the siteHeuristic Violated : H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist DesignSeverity Level : [Level 1 – Cosmetic Problem]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1 – Login and View Tools]Description :There is a different UI on the about page and not the same size boxes for the pictures, which makes the page look not cohesive.Suggestion to Fix :Fix the size of the boxes and ensure it’s consistent stylingOverall RecommendationsMajor issues regarding inconsistent search results, lack of ”Back” buttons, and broken links greatly impact user experience. These problems lead to reduced user engagement with the website and associated services, especially when an action does not align with the users’ expectations. Furthermore, ensuring font consistency and adding usage instructions will improve the user experience, both from a design perspective and user understanding.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P16Heuristic Violated : H[10]: [Help & 	Documentation]Severity Level : [Medium]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :We had to rely on a printed instruction sheet 	to complete the tasks, which shows that the 	app does not offer clear help or explanations.

These imply that users should type in queries that they can enter into an LLM, instead of a search. There is a mismatch between typing a task vs. tool.Suggestion to Fix :The placeholder text can be changed to values that imply searching of tools, such as ‘image’, ‘chat’, ‘coding’, etc. Heuristic Violated : H9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from ErrorsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :When the search returns zero tools, the page only states, “Showing 0 tool(s)”, “No AI recommendations returned”. In this situation, users are left with no guidance on how to recover. There is no indication to change their query, broaden the query, check spelling, etc.Suggestion to Fix :A solution to this problem would be to add a recovery phrase such as “Try ‘chat’, ‘image’, or ‘coding’”. There could also be an additional statement that says “No tools could be found with that phrase, please try a different keyword”.Heuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :In the “Request a new tool” form, only the field with “Contact Info” is labeled as optional. The other fields are not labeled as required. There is also no validation after submission, so users may fill out the form by leaving some required fields blank, causing misfiled forms.Suggestion to Fix :A solution to this problem would be to put required fields with an (*). In addition, when submitted without filling out necessary fields, there should be an inline display error next to the missing fields.Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :On the mock login page, the demo account information is small and placed above the login information. When logging in, the browser’s “Save Password?” prompt blocks the full view to the credentials. There is only a small indicator at the bottom that the credentials are invalid. Users may attempt to login several times after entering the wrong credentials, with no hint regarding the correct one.Suggestion to Fix :A solution to this would be to enlarge or move the demo account instructions below the sign in input boxes. That way, the browser’s dialog box would not block the credentials.Heuristic Violated : H3: User Control and FreedomSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :When logged in as an admin, the admin can perform very destructive actions such as hiding tools from the catalog without any confirmation dialogue. A single misclick could remove a tool from the catalog.Suggestion to Fix :Add a confirmation step to the hide action. This would prevent any issues regarding misclicks. Heuristic Violated : H4: Consistency and StandardsSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :The error messages are not styled or written consistently when viewing the entire interface. The login page shows a small, lowercase “invalid credentials” message while others are capitalized differently, or more descriptive. These issues make the messages look out of place.Suggestion to Fix :A suggestion to fix this would be to have proper capitalization on all errors. In addition, the level of descriptiveness should be consistent. For example, the tool query error could have a recovery phrase telling the user to try a different input. The thread not found error could have more details regarding the issue (maybe it was deleted, etc.) and the login error could have an addition of “Please check your username and password”. This would keep the error messages consistent.Overall RecommendationsOverall, I believe this group did very well in their overall design. The interface could however be clearer, especially in its communication based on what users can do and fix mistakes. The biggest issue here is lack of checks when taking powerful actions such as the hide action the admin has access to. The search and forms should match the expectations user may have such as correct placeholder text and clearly marked required fields. Also, the consistency of error messages would help the application seem more professional. With all these changes, the system would be more predictable and understandable.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P18Heuristic Violated : H[1]: [Visibility of system status]Severity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [all]Description :Logos and images fail to load, leaving blank placeholders.Suggestion to Fix :Add prospering loading states and ensure images are correct. Heuristic Violated : H[2]: [aesthetic and minimalist design]Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [task 1]Description :The page presents a large block of text with no spacing, making it difficult for users to tell what is important.Suggestion to Fix :Reduce text density, add spacing, and increase line breaks. Heuristic Violated : H[3]: [user control and freedom]Severity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :Users cannot delete their account, meaning they cannot exit their account.Suggestion to Fix :Add a “delete account”  option in the settings section. Heuristic Violated : H[6]: [recognition rather than recall]Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [task 2]Description :Users expect the “view more” feature to expand the content or show full comments but nothing appears.Suggestion to Fix :Make the “view more” feature expand and the comment section link directly to the full thread. Heuristic Violated : H[4]: [consistency and standards]Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [task 1]Description :The bottom carousel visually looks interactive but the icons cannot be tapped.Suggestion to Fix :Enable tapping on each icon and link them to the corresponding tool pages. Heuristic Violated : H[10]: [help and documentation]Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All tasks]Description :There is no help button or FAQ pages. This can be an issue for users who want to troubleshoot issues.Suggestion to Fix :Add a help page with instructions that can instruct users on what to do if they’re stuck. Overall RecommendationsThis interface can benefit from overall clarity. One thing is restoring the broken images and reducing the text clutter. This would help improve readability. Features like help and delete account can also support users. Ensuring all interactive elements behave as expected will also reduce confusion. Overall, fixing this issues will make the platform overall more aesthetically pleasing and reliable.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P19Heuristic Violated : H1Severity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :The error message is not need or unnecessary for the usersSuggestion to Fix :Remove the error message or hide it  or make it something more non technicalHeuristic Violated : H4Severity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :I would like the blue hue to be the size as the one in the image at the bottomSuggestion to Fix :make it the same so it can be consistent across the boardHeuristic Violated : H1Severity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [1]Description :Although this is very picky and very stupid, I feel like a error message, to tell user if there user or password is invalid rather than have it just say invalidSuggestion to Fix :tell the user why their login is invalidHeuristic Violated : H8Severity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :The time and star rating is redundant, I feel like we can already see the time and start why should it be thereSuggestion to Fix :remove the star and timeHeuristic Violated : H1Severity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :When contacting the user about what to do It’s a bit confusing.

I cant say anything bad about it if I am being honest. I just nit pick and suggested some few other functions. Other than that good job.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P20Heuristic Violated : H4: ConsistencySeverity Level : [1]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :The buttons have inconsistent coloring.

To unbookmark, users must search up the item in the search bar, which is inconvenient.Suggestion to Fix :Allow users to unbookmark saved items from directly within the bookmark section in their profile.Heuristic Violated : H3: ConsistencySeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :The status text in the upper right hand corner of the request is inconsistent in alignment. One of the texts is more left aligned than the other.Suggestion to Fix :Make the text alignment consistent for each request.Heuristic Violated : H3: FreedomSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [2]Description :When a user chooses to view a review for a tool, there are no options on the screen to go back or be redirected to the previous page.Suggestion to Fix :Add a way for users to go back to the tool description after viewing a review for a tool.Heuristic Violated : H5: Error PreventionSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [2]Description :There is no confirm to delete prompt that helps prevent users from accidentally deleting their review.Suggestion to Fix :Add a confirm to delete prompt when users delete review to ensure that a mistake is not being made.Overall RecommendationsOverall, the application is well thought out and nicely done. There are some issues with error prevention because users can delete reviews accidentally as there is no confirm to delete prompt. Users can also edit personal information and remove their name completely and save it. The application should take this into consideration so as to prevent potential errors in the future for their users.Certain default actions are unavailable to the user as well. The application needs to consider what actions users should be able to do, such as going back to a previous page or unbookmarking, and add these functionalities to enhance user experience.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P21Heuristic Violated : H1: visibility of site statusSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [All]Description :Website has large margins between the boxes and the actual screen.

What if a user wants to appeal a ban or deletion of their comment or tool?Suggestion to Fix :Add a way to contact - either an email or maybe a messaging Overall RecommendationsSite looks very professional. Needs some functional tweeks for user interaction.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P22Heuristic Violated : H1: Visibility of System StatusSeverity Level : [Level 2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :When logging in with any test user, the system does not provide feedback that the login was successful.The page simply refreshes and new icons appear, but there is no confirmation, animation, or indicator, causing users to question whether the action worked.Suggestion to Fix :Add a small login confirmation signal (e.g., “Logged in as Alice”).Maybe add a visual highlight/animationHeuristic Violated : H6: Recognition rather than RecallSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :-After bookmarking a tool, the user has no visible or intuitive way to find their saved tools-There is no “bookmarks” tab, icon, or menu item anywhere on the main interfaceSuggestion to Fix :Add a clear “Bookmarks” or “Saved Tools” button on the main navigation barInclude a small confirmation with a linkHeuristic Violated : H9 – Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From ErrorsSeverity Level : [4]Task(s) Affected : [Task 2]Description :When trying to verify comments between two different users, clicking “View More” on any thread causes the system to either display a “Thread not found” page. This completely stops the user from seeing the full discussion. There is also no fallback, message, or graceful handling, so users have no way to recover.Suggestion to Fix :Show a readable in-app error message (e.g., “This thread cannot be loaded right now”). The team should also fix the underlying route handling so that thread IDs are properly passed and rendered without breaking.Heuristic Violated : H9 - Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From ErrorsSeverity Level : [4 – Usability Catastrophe]Task(s) Affected : [Task 1]Description :When navigating to the Articles section and selecting the first article from the list, the user is taken to a 404 Page Not Found error. Users are left confused about whether the article is broken, removed, or incorrectly linked. Because articles are a core part of the browsing task, this blocks users from completing the activity entirely.Suggestion to Fix :Ensure all article links point to valid internal contentProvide alternative navigation back to the Articles page or suggest similar articlesHeuristic Violated : H6 – Recognition Rather Than RecallSeverity Level : [3]Task(s) Affected : [Task 3]Description :The admin tool creation form requires entering fields such as slug, name, summary, details, and helpful attributes with no examples, descriptions, or assistance. Admins must recall formatting rules for slugs and content structures.Suggestion to Fix :Add placeholder examples, tooltips on each field.Heuristic Violated : H5 – Error PreventionSeverity Level : [2]Task(s) Affected : [3]Description :Many admin actions occur immediately with no confirmation dialogs. These actions impact the visibility of community content. Accidental taps can lead to serious errors.Suggestion to Fix :Add confirmation dialogs like “Are you sure you want to hide this tool?”. Maybe add an undo optionOverall RecommendationsWhile going through the site, I noticed that AI Compass needs better feedback for user actions. Logging in, bookmarking, and several admin actions don’t give any sort of confirmation, so it’s unclear if something actually worked. Navigation also gets confusing, especially when trying to find bookmarks, and the first article in the Articles section leads to a broken link, which completely blocks that task. The search bar isn’t very clear about what it’s actually searching, so results don’t always match what users expect. On top of that, the admin tool creation page makes you remember formatting rules because there are no examples or hints. Fixing these issues would make the site feel smoother, clearer, and overall much easier to use.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
